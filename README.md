# JordanNirsISCAnalyses

These analyses are very preliminary (and this is my first real project that I'm posting on git). I'm working to make 
the code more user-friendly (to comment it and make it more elegant)... 

These scripts are for running ISC analyses with two groups watching two videos - they allow for comparing the ISC values
of an individual with their own group v. with the other group.

This repository includes current script for preprocessing, computing ISC values, testing them, and then visualizing.
